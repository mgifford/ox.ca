# In Brief

I'm passionate about sustainability, accessibility and open. Planet, people and collaboration to make our lives better. I work at [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) as the Open Standards and Practices Lead. I'm a [W3C Invited Expert](https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/list/?initial=g) and play a leadership role in an [accessibility community group](https://www.w3.org/community/arrm/) and a [web sustainability interest group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/).
