  Proposal title: We Need to Support Authors Better to Deliver Accessible Content
  Track: Collaboration and content management
  Time: 30min

  Four years ago, the We4Authors initiative united several content management tools (mostly open source) to identify and document accessibility best practices in preparation for the European Accessibility Act. It was the most coordinated effort to help content authors produce accessible digital content at scale. Yet, despite the groundwork, only the recommendations have not been widely adopted. The Web Almanac confirms what many suspected: web accessibility has not meaningfully improved in preparation for the Act’s introduction. https://events.drupal.org/europe2020/sessions/top-cms-tools-are-working-together-build-more-inclusive-world.html

  Much of this was built on or extending ideas in Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0. https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/

  Today, the context has changed.

  Artificial Intelligence—especially small, local language models—offers a new opportunity to deliver accessibility guidance where it’s needed most: at the moment of authoring. CMSs can leverage open source AI to suggest accessible alternatives, improve media descriptions, and identify structural issues in real time—without sending user data to third parties or compromising privacy.

  This talk will explore how we can:
	•	Revisit the ATAG 2.0 & We4Authors guidance and align it with today’s AI capabilities. https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/
	•	Integrate small language models within CMS authoring environments.
	•	Collaborate across open source communities building on the Open Web Alliance
	•	Build shared datasets, APIs, and modules to improve author support and accessible defaults.

  Accessibility progress requires shared effort, not just compliance checklists. Let’s use open collaboration and new tools to help every author publish content that works for everyone.

    <div class="notes" hidden>Thank organizers. Frame: authors, not auditors.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Why authors:</strong> Most accessibility failures originate during authoring (structure, links, images,
        tables, headings, media alternatives). Audits only detect the outcomes.</p>
      <p><strong>Scope of talk:</strong> ATAG 2.0 Part B (author support), We4Authors work, and what local AI changes
        (context-aware guidance at the moment of authoring).</p>
      <p><strong>Key claim this talk defends:</strong> Accessible content at scale requires better tooling defaults and
        in-context guidance, not more one-off training.</p>

    <h2 id="problem-heading">The Definition of Insanity</h2>
    <p>The Cycle of Failure:</p>
    <ul class="emerge">
      <li>We train authors &rarr; they leave &rarr; we retrain</li>
      <li>Authors are SMEs, not accessibility experts</li>
      <li>The CMS as filter — If the filter allows garbage, we get garbage</li>
      <li>Focus on authors, not auditors</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="notes" hidden>Prevention beats remediation. CMS is the gate.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claims behind the bullets:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training churn:</strong> Organizations repeatedly retrain because authors change roles or leave.
          Tooling must carry knowledge forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Authors are SMEs:</strong> Subject matter experts are not expected to be accessibility specialists.
          The system must make the accessible path the easy path.</li>
        <li><strong>CMS as filter:</strong> If the editor allows missing headings, bad link text, empty alt, broken
          table structure, inaccessible embeds, you will publish those defects at scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Shift focus:</strong> Support authors where decisions are made, instead of relying on auditors after
          publication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Supportive standards context:</strong> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) explicitly frames
        authoring tools as responsible for both accessible UIs and helping produce accessible content.

      <div>
        <h3>Part A: The Editor UI</h3>
        <p>The authoring interface itself must be accessible.</p>
        <p>~25% of the population has a disability (including authors).</p>

      <p><strong>ATAG 2.0 structure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Part A:</strong> the authoring interface itself is accessible (authors can have disabilities too).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Part B:</strong> the tool supports producing accessible output (prompts, checks, repair help,
          accessible defaults).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why “missing standard”:</strong> WCAG is widely discussed, but ATAG adoption is limited. Many systems
        treat author support as documentation, not product requirements.</p>

      <li>ATAG 2.0 is now over a decade old, prior to current LLM acceleration</li>
      <li>Code on its own can provide guardrails, but guidance is limited</li>
      <li>AI allows us to move to providing more custom assistance to authors</li>

    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claims behind the bullets:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>ATAG 2.0 predates today’s LLM tooling. The original guidance assumed mostly static rules and limited context
          awareness.</li>
        <li>Rules-based guardrails are useful but shallow. They catch “missing alt” but not “bad alt for this image and
          this page goal.”</li>
        <li>Local AI can provide contextual assistance at authoring time: suggestions, checks, and coaching tied to the
          actual draft content.</li>
        <li>This is not about generating more content. It is about better decisions by humans, supported by tooling.

        <li><strong>CMS boundary:</strong> Keeping the pipeline local reduces legal and procurement friction and
          supports regulated environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Choice of models:</strong> Administrators need options (small language models, local deployments,
          enterprise-approved models) and the ability to tune prompts for authoring context.</li>
        <li><strong>Guardrails:</strong> Constrain inputs and outputs, log what was suggested, and require human

        <li><strong>Plain language &amp; captions:</strong> AI can draft simplifications and media alternatives, but
          accessibility risk rises if teams treat drafts as final.</li>
        <li><strong>Friction as safety:</strong> Require explicit review actions (for example, a checkbox, a short
          confirmation, or “explain why this is accurate”) before publish.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>ATAG 2.0:</strong> the standards basis for accessible authoring tools and author support.
          https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/</li>
        <li><strong>ATAG Community Group:</strong> where coordination and modern tooling alignment is happening.
          https://github.com/w3c-cg/atag</li>
        <li><strong>WCAG-EM draft:</strong> the evolving evaluation methodology that can be partially automated.
          https://w3c.github.io/wai-wcag-em/</li>
        <li><strong>We4Authors archive:</strong> prior research, gaps, and recommendations.
          https://mgifford.github.io/We4Authors/</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Scan the QR and write down one specific change you will implement (one ATAG Part B
        practice, one editor check, one publishing gate, or one evaluation automation).</p>

        <li>Which authoring surface: Drupal, WordPress, headless CMS, Git-based publishing, custom editor?</li>
