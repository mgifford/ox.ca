  Proposal title: Accessible Sovereignty: Why the Four Freedoms Depend on Inclusion
  Track: Community
  Time: 25min

  Abstract: The four essential freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation — freedom 0: the freedom to run the software; freedom 1: the freedom to study &amp; change it; freedom 2: the freedom to redistribute; freedom 3: the freedom to distribute modified versions — are widely cited as the foundation of free software. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms

  But what does “freedom” mean when people with disabilities cannot meaningfully use, extend &amp; share software? Digital sovereignty is hollow unless the tools &amp; communities respect accessibility. If a user interface or workflow excludes a segment of users, then the right to “run” or “modify” the software is in practice restricted.

  This talk argues that accessibility (in code, UI, documentation, communities) is not an optional add-on — it is essential for the exercise of the four freedoms &amp; thus for true digital sovereignty. We will explore how CMS projects can embed accessibility into their governance, workflows &amp; contributions so that every user can exercise the freedoms of use, study, share &amp; collaborate.

  It is great to see GitHub making significant efforts to improve their accessibility &amp; that of the tools that they give to the community. https://accessibility.github.com/
  https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/our-pledge-to-help-improve-the-accessibility-of-open-source-software-at-scale/

  We will cover:
  • How exclusion of users with disabilities limits freedom of software use &amp; modification.
  • The link between accessibility &amp; community inclusivity: if you cannot participate fully, you cannot help shape the software.
  • Practical steps for CMS ecosystems (Drupal, WordPress, etc) to make accessibility a governance norm rather than a compliance afterthought.
  • A call to action: build tools, policies &amp; default workflows so that accessibility becomes part of the infrastructure of freedom.

  Notes: I should be available both days to present in person. Sorry I couldn't modify the submission to add that in.

      <p>Opening: Sovereignty is a discipline, not a product. Inclusion is the practice that keeps freedom usable.</p>

    <h2>The Core Premise</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital sovereignty is built on the Four Freedoms—but without accessibility, that freedom is theoretical</li>
      <li>Accessibility &amp; software freedom are interdependent: each enables the other at scale</li>
      <li>Sovereignty = the ability to perceive, operate &amp; control. If you cannot use the tool, <strong>you are not
          sovereign</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="notes" aria-hidden="true">Accessibility &amp; Freedom are related concepts.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p>Define digital sovereignty as the ability for people &amp; their communities to control &amp; adapt the digital
        tools, data &amp; infrastructure they rely on.</p>
      <p>“Open without accessible” is exclusion — a library with the lights turned off vs a visible, usable one where
        everyone can use, study &amp; share. Pair governance with tooling (licensing checks, accessibility automation in
        CI/CD) so freedom is testable, not aspirational.</p>

      <p>Accessibility is the practical foreground of sovereignty—functional power to exercise rights.</p>
      <p>Barriers to access predate FOSS. See the first wave of adaptive tech: <a

          accessibility inventions</a>.</p>
      <p>Both accessibility &amp; free software ask us to think beyond the present self. Use POUR as the operational
        lens that keeps freedoms real across contexts.</p>

    <h2>Liberté 0: A11y as Freedom 0</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A decade ago at FOSDEM, Liberté 0 asked: what is Freedom 0 worth if disabled people cannot use it?</li>
      <li>With 1/4 of people having a disability, accessibility must be fundamental—baked in, not bolted on</li>

      <p>Core claim: accessibility missing from GNU Freedom 0. Stallman said add it later; Liberté 0 said inaccessible
        software already violates Freedom 0.</p>

  <section class="slide textfit sprite" id="community-keeps-freedom" aria-label="Community is What Keeps Freedom Alive">
    <h2>Community is What Keeps Freedom Alive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FOSS thrives because people care enough to participate, modify &amp; share</li>
      <li>Accessibility thrives when communities care about others</li>
      <li>Freedom to improve requires the ability to participate</li>
      <li>Disability is innately human. We all have temporary &amp; situational barriers</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="notes" aria-hidden="true">Show of hands: Is software freedom a human right?</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p>Frame accessibility as community practice: people caring for each other is what keeps the freedoms alive.</p>
      <p>Use the Microsoft Inclusive Design lens (permanent, temporary, situational barriers): <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/">Inclusive design principles</a>. Everyone cycles through
        different ability states; building for variation protects future you.</p>
      <p>Example practice: set contribution norms that welcome assistive tech users (clear labels, semantic HTML, alt
        text, keyboard paths) so people can join, modify &amp; share.</p>
