  Proposal title: Accessible Sovereignty: Why the Four Freedoms Depend on Inclusion

  Abstract: The four essential freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation — freedom 0: the freedom to run the software; freedom 1: the freedom to study and change it; freedom 2: the freedom to redistribute; freedom 3: the freedom to distribute modified versions — are widely cited as the foundation of free software. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms

  But what does “freedom” mean when people with disabilities cannot meaningfully use, extend, and share software? Digital sovereignty is hollow unless the tools and communities respect accessibility. If a user interface or workflow excludes a segment of users, then the right to “run” or “modify” the software is in practice restricted.

  This talk argues that accessibility (in code, UI, documentation, communities) is not an optional add-on — it is essential for the exercise of the four freedoms, and thus for true digital sovereignty. We will explore how CMS projects can embed accessibility into their governance, workflows and contributions so that every user can exercise the freedoms of use, study, share and collaborate.

  It is great to see GitHub making significant efforts to improve their accessibility, and that of the tools that they give to the community. https://accessibility.github.com/
  https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/our-pledge-to-help-improve-the-accessibility-of-open-source-software-at-scale/

  We will cover:
  • How exclusion of users with disabilities limits freedom of software use and modification.
  • The link between accessibility and community inclusivity: if you cannot participate fully, you cannot help shape the software.
  • Practical steps for CMS ecosystems (Drupal, WordPress, etc) to make accessibility a governance norm rather than a compliance afterthought.
  • A call to action: build tools, policies and default workflows so that accessibility becomes part of the infrastructure of freedom.

  Notes: I should be available both days to present in person. Sorry I couldn't modify the submission to add that in.

   <h1>Accessible Sovereignty: Why the Four Freedoms Depend on Inclusion</h1>
   <h2>Sovereignty is a practice; accessibility is the power to exercise it.</h2>
   <address>Mike Gifford, CivicActions</address>
   <p class="event">FOSDEM 2026 | Digital Sovereignty Track<br>Date & Location TBD</p>
  <aside class="notes">Opening: Sovereignty is a discipline, not a product. So is inclusion. If you stop practicing, it atrophies. Inclusion operationalizes freedom. I’m here to talk about a 'bug' in the way we view freedom. A legal right (the license) without functional power (accessibility) is an empty promise. Full submitted abstract is preserved in the comment above the cover slide.</aside>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 2 -->
  <section class="slide" id="core-premise">
   <h2>The Core Premise</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The foundation: Digital sovereignty is built on the Four Freedoms</li>
    <li>The problem: Digital freedom is an illusion without accessibility</li>
    <li>The thesis: Accessibility is the infrastructure that makes software freedom possible</li>
    <li>Sovereignty = control; reliance on intermediaries erodes autonomy</li>
    <li>If you cannot perceive/operate the tool, you are not sovereign</li>
   </ul>
     <aside class="notes">Define digital sovereignty as the ability for people and their communities to control and adapt the digital tools, data, and infrastructure they rely on. You have no freedom without accessibility: “open without accessible” is exclusion — a library with the lights turned off vs a living, visible forest where everyone can use, study, and share. Pair governance with tooling: just as DejaCode keeps licensing honest, ship accessibility automation (e.g., axe) in CI/CD so freedom is testable, not aspirational.</aside>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 3 -->
  <section class="slide" id="freedoms">
   <h2>Re-evaluating the Four Freedoms</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Freedom 0 (Run): Requires perceivable, operable UI</li>
    <li>Freedom 1 (Study): Requires accessible documentation, open standards, and accessible CLIs</li>
    <li>Freedom 2 (Redistribute): Requires accessible forges (GitHub, GitLab) and accessible package managers</li>
    <li>Freedom 3 (Modify &amp; share): Requires accessible editors/IDEs and accessible authoring tools (ATAG 2.0)</li>
   </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Map 0–3 to POUR: P/O unlock run; P/U unlock study; R keeps outputs and forks usable across contexts. Freedom 2: forges must be navigable and usable. Freedom 3: editors and IDEs (VSCode, Vim, etc.) and authoring platforms (ATAG 2.0). Cite FSF Four Freedoms: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms. If POUR breaks, the freedoms are theoretical.</aside>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 4 -->
  <section class="slide" id="foreground-accessibility">
   <h2>Accessibility: The Foreground of Sovereignty</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Accessibility long predates free software: a tradition of adaptive tech</li>
    <li>Digital accessibility is the everyday practice of sovereignty</li>
    <li>Think beyond “me-now”: design for future-you and for others</li>
    <li>Accessibility and free software both expand options over time</li>
    <li>Build for variation and resilience; preserve paths to participation</li>
   </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Frame accessibility as the practical foreground of sovereignty—functional power to exercise rights. Barriers to access existed long before FOSS; see historical inventions: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2005-06/accessibility/firstwave.html. Both accessibility and free software ask us to think bigger than the present self, giving the future “me” more options. Use POUR as the operational lens that keeps freedoms real across contexts.</aside>

  <!-- Slide 5 -->
  <section class="slide" id="community-keeps-freedom">
   <h2>Community Keeps Freedom Alive</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>FOSS thrives because people care enough to fix and share</li>
    <li>Accessibility thrives when communities care about present and future selves</li>
    <li>If you cannot participate fully, you cannot help shape the software</li>
    <li>Inclusive design covers permanent, temporary, and situational barriers</li>
    <li>Personalization is a feature, not a fork: build for variation in ability</li>
   </ul>
     <aside class="notes">Replace the Machine/Mycelium metaphor with community reality. Microsoft Inclusive Design lens: permanent, temporary, situational barriers all need coverage. Accessibility is the same adaptability that lets FOSS communities riff and personalize for today’s needs.</aside>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 6 -->
  <section class="slide" id="inclusive-design">
   <h2>Inclusive Design: The Multiplier</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Permanent: low vision, mobility limits, cognitive load</li>
    <li>Temporary: broken arm, eye infection, jet lag</li>
    <li>Situational: glare, bad Wi‑Fi, noisy room</li>
      <li>Curb-Cut Effect: screen reader fixes often improve SEO and performance</li>
    <li>Design for variation; better defaults for everyone</li>
   </ul>
   <aside class="notes">These states rotate through a community. Building flexibility now protects the future-you and keeps the Four Freedoms usable when circumstances change.</aside>
  </section>

    <!-- Slide 7 -->
    <section class="slide" id="participant-engagement">
    <h2>Participant Engagement</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Show of hands: Is software freedom a human right?</li>
     <li>Follow-up: Have you audited your own contribution workflow for accessibility this year?</li>
     <li>Gap reality: Most hands go down — that is the sovereignty gap</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Use this early to align values vs practice. Prompt attention to pipelines: PR templates, issue forms, CI logs, CLI prompts.</aside>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 8 -->
    <section class="slide" id="sovereignty-gap">
    <h2>The Sovereignty Gap</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>When a person cannot report a bug or suggest a fix, Freedom 3 is lost</li>
     <li>Exclusion from contribution turns sovereign users into passive consumers</li>
     <li>Fix the gap: accessible forges, forms, CI, and review checklists</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Tie back to POUR and governance: contribution workflows must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Link the handout table for role-based actions.</aside>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 9 -->
    <section class="slide" id="accessible-forge">
     <h2>Industry Momentum: The Accessible Forge</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure providers set the floor: accessible repos, CI, and design systems</li>
      <li>Example: GitHub’s accessibility pledge and Primer accessibility work</li>
      <li>Automate checks: axe in CI/CD, alongside license/compliance tools (e.g., DejaCode)</li>
      <li>Outcome: when the forge is accessible, downstream ecosystems widen</li>
     </ul>
     <aside class="notes">Link to GitHub commitments: https://accessibility.github.com/ and https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/our-pledge-to-help-improve-the-accessibility-of-open-source-software-at-scale/. Pair accessibility linting with SCA/license checks so pipelines guard freedom and compliance together.</aside>
    </section>

      <!-- Slide 10 -->
    <section class="slide" id="cms-governance">
     <h2>CMS Governance for Accessibility</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Ship accessible defaults and pattern libraries by default</li>
      <li>Require accessibility checks in PR/release workflows</li>
      <li>Make upstream-first fixes part of the contract, not a favor</li>
      <li>Assign an accessibility owner in project governance</li>
     </ul>
     <aside class="notes">Ground the abstract in CMS practice: Drupal/WordPress can bake accessibility into governance, review checklists, and pattern libraries. Upstream-first fixes prevent forks of inaccessible code. An explicit accessibility role in release governance keeps the discipline funded and accountable.</aside>
