  Proposal title: Accessible Sovereignty: Why the Four Freedoms Depend on Inclusion
  Track: Community
  Time: 25min

  Abstract: The four essential freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation — freedom 0: the freedom to run the software; freedom 1: the freedom to study &amp; change it; freedom 2: the freedom to redistribute; freedom 3: the freedom to distribute modified versions — are widely cited as the foundation of free software. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms

  But what does “freedom” mean when people with disabilities cannot meaningfully use, extend &amp; share software? Digital sovereignty is hollow unless the tools &amp; communities respect accessibility. If a user interface or workflow excludes a segment of users, then the right to “run” or “modify” the software is in practice restricted.

  This talk argues that accessibility (in code, UI, documentation, communities) is not an optional add-on — it is essential for the exercise of the four freedoms &amp; thus for true digital sovereignty. We will explore how CMS projects can embed accessibility into their governance, workflows &amp; contributions so that every user can exercise the freedoms of use, study, share &amp; collaborate.

  It is great to see GitHub making significant efforts to improve their accessibility &amp; that of the tools that they give to the community. https://accessibility.github.com/
  https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/our-pledge-to-help-improve-the-accessibility-of-open-source-software-at-scale/

  We will cover:
  • How exclusion of users with disabilities limits freedom of software use &amp; modification.
  • The link between accessibility &amp; community inclusivity: if you cannot participate fully, you cannot help shape the software.
  • Practical steps for CMS ecosystems (Drupal, WordPress, etc) to make accessibility a governance norm rather than a compliance afterthought.
  • A call to action: build tools, policies &amp; default workflows so that accessibility becomes part of the infrastructure of freedom.

  Notes: I should be available both days to present in person. Sorry I couldn't modify the submission to add that in.

      <div class="notes" hidden>I’m here to talk about a 'bug' in the way we view freedom.</div>
      <div class="details" hidden>Opening: Sovereignty is a discipline, not a product. So is inclusion. If you stop practicing, it atrophies. Inclusion operationalizes freedom. A legal right (the license) without functional power (accessibility) is an empty promise. Full submitted abstract is preserved in the comment above the cover slide.</div>

    <section class="slide textfit" id="core-premise" aria-label="The Core Premise">
      <h2>The Core Premise</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Foundation: Digital sovereignty is built on the Four Freedoms</li>
        <li>Problem: Digital freedom is an illusion without accessibility</li>
        <li>Thesis: Accessibility is the infrastructure that makes software freedom possible</li>
        <li>Sovereignty = control; reliance on intermediaries erodes autonomy</li>
        <li>If you cannot perceive/operate the tool, <strong>you are not sovereign</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="notes" aria-hidden="true"></div>
      <div class="details" hidden>Define digital sovereignty as the ability for people &amp; their communities to control &amp; adapt the digital tools, data &amp; infrastructure they rely on. You have no freedom without accessibility: “open without accessible” is exclusion — a library with the lights turned off vs a living, visible forest where everyone can use, study &amp; share. Pair governance with tooling: just as DejaCode keeps licensing honest, ship accessibility automation (e.g., axe) in CI/CD so freedom is testable, not aspirational.</div>

      <ul>
        <li>Freedom 0 (Use): <strong>Perceive</strong> perceive the UI </li>
        <li>Freedom 1 (Study/Edit/Improve): <strong>Operate</strong> operate &amp; open it </li>
        <li>Freedom 2 (Redistribute): Demonstrate <strong>understanding</strong></li>

        <li>Both involve thinking beyond “me-now” &amp; design for others</li>

Barriers to access existed long before FOSS; see historical inventions: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2005-06/accessibility/firstwave.html. Both accessibility &amp; free software ask us to think bigger than the present self, giving the future “me” more options. Use POUR as the operational lens that keeps freedoms real across contexts.</div>
