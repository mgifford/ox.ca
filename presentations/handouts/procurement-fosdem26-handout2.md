# Procurement handout: RFP clauses and evaluation checklist

This handout contains extended RFP clause examples and an evaluation checklist that procurement teams can copy into tenders.

## Example RFP clause: Upstream Contribution
Vendor must allocate effort in-scope to contributing back to upstream projects. All non-proprietary bug fixes and feature work required by this contract shall be submitted as pull requests to relevant upstream repositories within 30 days of delivery and linked in acceptance documentation.

## Example RFP clause: Public Repository Requirement
Vendor must create a public repository for all contract deliverables prior to final acceptance. The repository must include full git history, a LICENSE file, README, CONTRIBUTING guide, and CI checks for security and accessibility where applicable. Final acceptance requires a release tag or changelog entry.

## Example RFP clause: Maintenance Escrow
A small percentage (e.g., 1-5%) of milestone payments will be placed in escrow for maintenance activities. Funds will be released upon evidence of upstream merge or after a funded SLA is in place for maintenance of the delivered components.

## Evaluation checklist (acceptance team)
- PR links provided for all fixes/features
- Public repository URL provided and accessible
- LICENSE, README, and CONTRIBUTING present
- Release tag or changelog created
- CI checks pass for security/accessibility where applicable
- Evidence of maintainer engagement (issues, PR comments, merges)

## Notes
- Remove long RFP language from slides and include this handout as a downloadable resource/QR code link on the Resources slide.
- Keep slide examples short and point attendees to this handout for copy-paste clauses.
