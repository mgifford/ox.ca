   <h2>Accessibility in the EU</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Government lead the way with the Web Accessibility Directive (WAD).</li>
    <li>As part of this a new EU standard needed to be built, it became EN 301 549</li>
    <li>EN 301 549 is an evolving standard based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</li>
    <li>The next release is expected for early 2026 and on the web should mostly align with WCAG 2.2 AA</li>
   </ul>

    <p class="note">
      WAD established a public-sector floor for accessibility (Directive (EU) 2016/2102). EN 301 549 operationalizes that floor across ICT, not just websites, and is maintained by ETSI/CEN/CENELEC. EAA (Directive (EU) 2019/882) extends accessibility obligations to private-sector digital services and products but should be treated as a minimum legal baseline, not a quality target. WCAG remains the normative technical reference for web content via EN 301 549 §9. Ongoing revisions track W3C guidance; WCAG 2.2 became a W3C Recommendation in Oct 2023, and EN 301 549 v4.x is expected to incorporate it in 2026. Emphasize service-wide accessibility (end-to-end journeys, documents, mobile apps, support channels), not narrow page-level compliance. See: WAD Art. 1–3; EAA Annex I; EN 301 549 v3.2.1; W3C WCAG 2.2 Rec.

   <h2>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) &amp; All Things Digital</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>EAA (Directive 2019/882) extends beyond public sector; it covers services and products</li>
    <li><strong>June 28, 2025</strong>: Enforcement began; 27 member states = 27 different implementations</li>
    <li>Fines now reach up to €1,000,000 in some member states; market surveillance authorities monitor compliance</li>
    <li>Microenterprises (&lt;10 employees, &lt;€2M turnover) may be exempt in some jurisdictions</li>
    <li>EN 301 549: If your Drupal site sells a ticket but your help desk is inaccessible, you fail</li>
   </ul>

    <p class="note">
      EAA (Directive (EU) 2019/882) shifts accessibility from a public-sector obligation (WAD) to a market-wide requirement covering digital services and consumer-facing products. Scope includes e-commerce, transport ticketing, banking, e-books, audiovisual services, and associated support services. June 28, 2025 marked the enforcement deadline; products and services placed on the market after this date must comply unless exempt. Enforcement is decentralized: each of the 27 EU member states has transposed the directive into national law with variations in penalties, exemptions, and enforcement priorities. Market surveillance authorities in each state have powers including inspections, compliance orders, fines up to €1M (in some states like Germany's BFSG), and product/service withdrawal. Microenterprise exemptions (&lt;10 employees, &lt;€2M annual turnover) exist in some national laws but vary; exempt organizations still face civil liability risk. Do not assume uniform enforcement across borders. EN 301 549 is the technical backbone: accessibility applies end-to-end across the service, not just the website UI. If a Drupal site meets WCAG but the ticketing flow, PDFs, call center, or chat support are inaccessible, the service is non-compliant. Position EAA as a legal floor, not a maturity model; compliance requires service-wide design, procurement, and operations alignment. See: EAA Art. 1–4, 25–32, Annex I; EN 301 549 §§4–6, 9–11; national transposition laws via https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu

   <h2>Web Almanac 2025 — The Hard Truth</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Lighthouse scores trend up</li>
    <li>Only 31% of mobile sites tested meet color contrast requirements</li>
    <li>We are winning the automated war, losing the human one</li>
    <li>Comparing 2024 to the draft 2025 chapter a ~1% increase with domains hosted in the EU or with EU specific domains</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="note">
     Use Web Almanac data to expose the limits of automated metrics. Lighthouse accessibility scores continue to trend upward year over year, yet critical human-facing failures persist. In the 2024 Accessibility chapter, 29% of mobile pages met basic color contrast requirements, one of the most fundamental WCAG success criteria, despite widespread automated testing adoption. Automation catches syntax; it does not guarantee comprehension, operability, or task completion. Frame this as a measurement problem, not a tooling failure. The 2025 chapter draft (unpublished) reinforces this gap: legal pressure and automation improve scores, but human prioritization lags. Cite 2024 public data cautiously and label 2025 findings as preliminary. See: Web Almanac 2024 Accessibility chapter https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/accessibility and Lighthouse methodology https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/.

    <h2>WCAG 2.2 AA: The Practical Upgrade</h2>
    <p>Strengthens accessibility by removing cognitive barriers to login, making help predictable, improving touch accuracy, and ensuring keyboard focus is never lost.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Accessible authentication (3.3.8 AA)</li>
    <li>Consistent help (3.2.6 A)</li>
    <li>Target size minimum (2.5.8 AA)</li>
    <li>Focus not obscured (2.4.11 AA)</li>
   </ul>
  <p class="note">
    •	Accessible authentication (3.3.8 AA): No cognitive function tests are required for login unless an accessible alternative or assistive mechanism is provided. https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#accessible-authentication-minimum
    •	Consistent help (3.2.6 A): Help mechanisms, when present across pages, must appear in a consistent location. https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#consistent-help
    •	Target size minimum (2.5.8 AA): Pointer targets must be at least 24×24 CSS pixels, with defined exceptions. https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#target-size-minimum
    •	Focus not obscured (2.4.11 AA): Keyboard focus must not be completely hidden by author-created content. https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-not-obscured-minimum

   <h2>Accessibility Statements — Legal Evidence, Not Marketing</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Mandatory for WAD (public sector) and EAA-covered services</li>
    <li>Must document: conformance level (EN 301 549/WCAG 2.2 AA), test date, known issues, remediation timeline, feedback mechanism</li>
    <li>Reviewed during enforcement audits and civil disputes</li>
    <li>Drupal opportunity: standardized accessibility statement module or pattern</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="note">
     Accessibility statements are mandatory under WAD Art. 7 for public sector bodies and required for EAA-covered private services. They are not marketing pages; they are legal evidence reviewed during market surveillance audits and referenced in civil complaints. Required elements per Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523: the accessibility standard applied (typically EN 301 549 referencing WCAG 2.2 AA), test methodology and date, list of non-conformances with workarounds or alternatives, feedback mechanism for users to report issues, and link to the national enforcement procedure. Vague or outdated statements increase liability. Position this as both a compliance deliverable and a Drupal contribution opportunity: a standardized accessibility statement module for Drupal core or contrib, or a LocalGov Drupal pattern, could reduce duplication and improve consistency across councils and businesses. See: WAD Art. 7; EAA Annex I §III; Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2018/1523/oj; model accessibility statements https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/

   <h2>LocalGov Drupal — Collective Action on Accessibility</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>LGD targets WCAG 2.2 AA out of the box; shared patterns reduce per-council risk</li>
    <li>Example: Southwark PDF Importer turns inaccessible PDFs into accessible HTML for everyone</li>
    <li>Broader Drupal community: contribute accessibility fixes upstream to core and contrib modules</li>
    <li>Shared governance means faster remediation aligned with evolving standards (EN 301 549, WCAG updates)</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="note">
     Position LocalGov Drupal (LGD) as a model for collective action on accessibility under regulatory pressure. With the European Accessibility Act (Directive (EU) 2019/882), accessibility is a market requirement across digital services. LGD's WCAG 2.2 AA-by-default approach reduces compliance risk at delivery — https://docs.localgovdrupal.org/accessibility/ — not retrofitted later. Shared governance, reusable patterns, and upstream accessibility fixes mean councils and businesses are not solving the same legal and technical problems in isolation. This is risk pooling in practice. The Southwark PDF Importer is a concrete example: instead of publishing inaccessible PDFs, content is transformed into accessible HTML for all users. Extend this model to the broader Drupal community: accessibility fixes should land in Drupal core and widely-used contrib modules, not forks or custom code. Emphasize collaboration as a compliance multiplier: fewer bespoke fixes, faster upgrades, shared remediation aligned with EN 301 549 and WCAG evolution. Encourage agencies to contribute accessibility improvements upstream and participate in community governance. See: https://localgovdrupal.org; Drupal core accessibility issues https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=11.x&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=Accessibility

   <h2>EN 301 549 — The European Wrapper</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Legal benchmark for WAD and beyond; adopted globally (e.g., Canada) as the WCAG-plus profile</li>
    <li>Today aligns to WCAG 2.1 AA; v4.1.1 is expected in 2026 and will point to WCAG 2.2 — start migrating now</li>
    <li>Clause 11.7 (user preferences) means respecting browser/OS settings and offering personalization (light/dark, reduced motion)</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="note">
     Frame EN 301 549 as the legal and procurement wrapper that turns WCAG into enforceable requirements. It is the harmonised European Standard underpinning the Web Accessibility Directive and the European Accessibility Act, and it is increasingly reused outside the EU as a WCAG-plus baseline, including by Canada and other jurisdictions aligning procurement language to service-wide accessibility. EN 301 549 does not replace WCAG; it incorporates WCAG for web content and extends beyond it to cover software, documents, hardware, support services, and operational requirements. Current versions align primarily to WCAG 2.1 AA, but ETSI has signalled that v4.1.x (expected 2026) will reference WCAG 2.2. Waiting creates predictable remediation debt. Clause 11.7 is a concrete example of why this matters: respecting user preferences is no longer optional polish but a normative requirement, covering system color schemes, reduced motion, contrast preferences, and other OS or browser-level settings. Position this slide for procurement and policy audiences: specify EN 301 549 in contracts, track WCAG 2.2 now, and avoid locking suppliers into outdated compliance targets.

   <h2>AI &amp; Accessibility — Friend or Foe?</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Use AI for drafts: alt-text suggestions, structure checks</li>
    <li>Never outsource final judgment; humans feel friction, AI does not</li>
    <li>Keep data local; respect privacy and procurement constraints</li>
   </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Position AI as an assistive tool in the accessibility workflow, not a compliance shortcut. AI can accelerate early-stage tasks such as alt-text drafts, heading structure checks, and code suggestions, but it cannot evaluate lived experience, cognitive load, or task friction. Accessibility failures are often experiential, not syntactic. Automated systems do not feel confusion, fatigue, or frustration, and they routinely hallucinate confidence where none exists. Final accessibility decisions must remain human-led, supported by testing with assistive technologies and, where possible, disabled users. Emphasize data governance: public-sector and regulated environments must treat AI use as a procurement and privacy issue, not just a developer convenience. Prefer local or controlled models to avoid data leakage, training on sensitive content, or vendor lock-in. Explicitly caution against accessibility overlays and fully automated remediation claims, which have been widely criticized for failing users while increasing legal risk. Frame AI as a force multiplier for competent teams, not a replacement for accountability.

  <section class="slide" id="compliance-multiplier">
    <h2>Strategic Procurement (EN 301 549)</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Mandate accessibility statements as contractual deliverables with documented test evidence</li>
     <li>Mandate the LGD Pattern Library; no bespoke bugs on public money</li>
     <li>Ask for upstream history, not just "we know accessibility"</li>
     <li>Disproportionate burden is a legal defense under WAD/EAA, but requires documentation and remediation plans — not a get-out clause</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Frame procurement as the primary leverage point for accessibility outcomes. EN 301 549 only works if enforced at contract award, not retroactively. Accessibility statements must be contractual deliverables, not post-launch additions; require suppliers to deliver draft statements with test evidence as part of acceptance criteria. Mandating shared assets like the LocalGov Drupal Pattern Library prevents councils from paying repeatedly for the same accessibility bugs. "Upstream history" means asking vendors where fixes land: in a fork or in maintained open-source projects. Disproportionate burden (WAD Art. 5; EAA Recital 69) allows exemptions where compliance would impose an unreasonable organizational or financial burden, but it requires formal assessment, documentation, and a remediation timeline. In practice, disproportionate burden claims have been difficult to sustain (cf. US Section 508 undue burden precedent); they are not blanket exemptions. Include disproportionate burden assessment criteria in procurement for edge cases, but require evidence and plans. See: EN 301 549 procurement guidance https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu; WAD Art. 5; EAA Recital 69; LocalGov Drupal patterns https://patterns.localgovdrupal.org

   <h2>What to Do Monday — For Businesses Serving Europeans</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Audit your digital services against WCAG 2.2 AA; document gaps and known issues</li>
    <li>Draft or update your accessibility statement with conformance level, test date, and remediation timeline</li>
    <li>Review procurement contracts: ensure suppliers provide accessibility statements and test evidence</li>
    <li>Check your national EAA transposition law; enforcement varies by member state</li>
    <li>If you're a microenterprise, verify exemption eligibility in your jurisdiction — but plan for civil liability risk</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="note">
     This slide provides concrete first steps for businesses serving European customers post-June 28, 2025 deadline. Start with an accessibility audit against WCAG 2.2 AA (the likely basis of EN 301 549 v4.x); automated tools (Lighthouse, axe, WAVE) catch syntax but require manual follow-up for experiential issues. Document all non-conformances and create a remediation plan. Draft or update your accessibility statement per Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523; include conformance level, test methodology and date, list of known issues with workarounds, feedback mechanism, and link to national enforcement procedure. Review procurement and vendor contracts to ensure accessibility requirements are passed downstream; require suppliers to provide accessibility statements and documented test evidence as contractual deliverables. Check your national EAA transposition law via https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu; enforcement priorities, penalties, and exemptions vary by member state. If you qualify as a microenterprise (&lt;10 employees, &lt;€2M turnover), verify exemption eligibility in your jurisdiction, but note that exemptions do not shield against civil liability or private lawsuits. Treat Monday actions as risk mitigation, not one-time compliance theater. See: WCAG 2.2 https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/; Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523; EAA national laws https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu
