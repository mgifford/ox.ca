Drupal logos — usage & license
================================

Purpose
-------
This folder contains downloaded Drupal event logos and converted SVGs used for presentation assets. These files are included for convenience; please follow Drupal's trademark and logo policy before using them in public or commercial materials.

Trademark & logo guidance
-------------------------
- The Drupal trademark (the word "Drupal") is owned by Dries Buytaert. The trademark and logo policy governs use: https://www.drupal.org/about/trademark
- Official logos and icons may be subject to additional licensing and rules (see the media kit and logo pages linked from the policy).
- If in doubt, contact the Drupal trademark maintainers at trademark@association.drupal.org.

Mandatory attribution
---------------------
Use the following attribution where required or when reproducing the logo:

"Drupal is a registered trademark of Dries Buytaert."

Practical notes
---------------
- Do not alter official logos or combine them into other marks without permission. Avoid recolouring, reshaping, or embedding the icon into a new logo.
- Some files in this folder were generated by automated raster→SVG conversion; they may be raster-embedded rather than true vector traces. For publication-quality assets, prefer the official SVGs from the Drupal media kit or perform manual vector tracing (Inkscape, Illustrator) and verify fidelity.

Files in this folder
--------------------
- originals/ — downloaded raster images (PNG, JPG).
- svg/ — generated SVG files (may contain embedded raster data).

If you want, I can add license attribution text to pages that display these logos — tell me where to add it.
