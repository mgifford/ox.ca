  Proposal title: Procurement Is the Biggest Form of Fundraising for FLOSS
  Track: Funding the FOSS Ecosystem
  Time: 30min

  Free software has no shortage of talent, ideas, or users, but it does have a funding problem. The largest potential funding source already exists: public procurement. Governments spend billions each year on software &amp; digital services, but most of that money flows into proprietary silos that limit transparency, reuse &amp; sovereignty.

  If we take “Public Money, Public Code” - https://publiccode.eu -  seriously, we must recognize that procurement (not donations or sponsorships) is the most powerful lever to sustain open source. Every government contract is a potential long-term investment in the commons.

  This talk examines how procurement practices can become the backbone of sustainable free software ecosystems:
	•	Why procurement reform is essential to digital sovereignty.
	•	How existing frameworks (e.g., the EU Open Source Strategy - https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/digital-services/open-source-software-strategy_en ) still fall short.
	•	How to structure tenders, contracts &amp; governance to ensure open deliverables.
	•	Why governments should stop “buying software” &amp; start funding maintenance &amp; collaboration.
	•	The opportunity for community organizations &amp; small firms to compete fairly.

  Procurement is where ideals meet infrastructure. By redirecting even a small fraction of public IT budgets toward open, reusable solutions, we can achieve what years of advocacy &amp; fundraising have not: a self-sustaining free software ecosystem that serves everyone.

      Funding the FOSS Ecosystem</p>
    <div class="notes" hidden>Procurement funds maintenance, not charity. Name + role. Thesis.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Public procurement is the largest realistic funding stream for long-term open source
        maintenance, because it is recurring, budgeted, and tied to mission delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Anchor concept:</strong> “Public Money, Public Code” argues that publicly funded software should be
        publicly reusable. https://publiccode.eu/</p>
      <p><strong>Why this talk exists:</strong> Donations are episodic. Procurement is structural. If procurement
        requires open deliverables and upstream contributions, it becomes durable funding for the commons.</p>

  <!-- Problem slide: Charity Model -->
  <section class="slide" id="charity-model" aria-label="The Problem: Charity Model">
    <h2>The Problem: The Charity Model Is Broken</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relying on donations leads to maintainer burnout &amp; fragile projects</li>
      <li>Unfunded maintenance creates insecure supply chains</li>
      <li>Donations don't scale to meet the maintenance needs of infrastructure</li>
      <li class="next"><strong>Infrastructure needs ongoing, reliable investments</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <div class="notes" hidden>Supply-chain risk. Log4j, xz. Maintenance is security.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Unfunded maintenance creates systemic security risk because critical components are
        widely reused without sustainable staffing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Log4Shell (Log4j):</strong> widely used Java logging library vulnerability exposed how understaffed
          infrastructure projects can be. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-356a</li>
        <li><strong>xz-utils backdoor attempt:</strong> shows social engineering and maintainer compromise risk in core
          tooling. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/03/29/reported-supply-chain-compromise-affecting-xz-utils-data-compression-library-cve-2024-3094</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> “Maintenance” is not optional work. It is security work. Procurement can fund it
        as operational necessity.</p>

      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> We overweight small-dollar fundraising because it is culturally familiar, but it cannot
        match the scale of public procurement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Donations/pledges:</strong> useful, but unpredictable and limited in scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement:</strong> budgets exist already; the question is what requirements they enforce (open
          deliverables, maintenance, upstream work).</li>

      <p><strong>Speaker point:</strong> This talk is not anti-donation. It is “stop pretending donations solve

    <h2>The Pivot: Operational Maintenance</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div>
        <h3>Problem: Central Funding is Fragile</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Grants/Sponsorships end abruptly</li>
          <li>Political shifts enable cuts (STF risk)</li>

          <li><strong>Proprietary:</strong> High OpEx (Rent)</li>
          <li><strong>OSS (Broken):</strong> Unfunded Maint.</li>
          <li><strong>OSS (Resilient):</strong> ~20% allocated to upstream maintenance</li>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="notes" hidden>Move to funded OpEx. 20% upstream rule.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Central grants are fragile. Procurement is distributed and recurring. That creates
        resilience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grants end:</strong> timeboxed funding does not guarantee long-term maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Political risk:</strong> centrally administered funds can be cut; distributed procurement spreads
          risk across many buyers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Practical rule of thumb:</strong> When adopting OSS, allocate a predictable slice of delivery spend to
        upstream maintenance (your “~20%” example) and treat it as ongoing operations, not a one-time project cost.</p>

  <!-- Slide 6 -->

    <h2>Why procurement should treat FOSS as infrastructure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open Standards: prevent lock-in</li>

    <div class="details" hidden>Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
      <ul>
        <li>Open Source &amp; Digital Public Goods: the engine</li>
        <li>Open Standards: the rails</li>
        <li>Open Data: the cargo</li>

    </div>
    <div class="notes" hidden>DPI stack: standards, code, governance. Mention OpenACR.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) requires open standards, open code, and open
        governance to prevent capture and enable auditability and reuse.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open standards:</strong> reduce lock-in and keep data portable.</li>
        <li><strong>Open source:</strong> enables auditing, reuse, and faster remediation across organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Open governance:</strong> reduces single-vendor control of critical systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Procurement evidence example:</strong> Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) are a structured way to
        require and evaluate claims. OpenACR is an initiative for an open format and tooling. https://openacr.org/</p>
      <p><strong>Speaker caution:</strong> If “AI” is mentioned here, keep it grounded: the issue is not novelty, it is
        whether systems remain auditable and controllable under public accountability.</p>

        recurring maintenance funding.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fund open deliverables:</strong> require public repos, open licenses, and open standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring contracts:</strong> create predictable maintenance revenue, reducing burnout and improving
          security posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse:</strong> open deliverables let other agencies adopt without repaying for the same work.</li>
        <li><strong>Small policy changes scale:</strong> one agency clause replicated across frameworks becomes
          structural funding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Concrete procurement rule you can defend:</strong> “No public money without a public repo.” Tie it to
        verification (license, CI, issue tracker, release tags).</p>
      <p><strong>Optional budgeting rule:</strong> reserve a defined maintenance allocation for upstream work (your “1%”
        or “20%” framing, depending on audience).</p>
