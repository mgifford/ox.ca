  Proposal title: Procurement Is the Biggest Form of Fundraising for FLOSS
  Track: Funding the FOSS Ecosystem
  Time: 30min

  Free software has no shortage of talent, ideas, or users, but it does have a funding problem. The largest potential funding source already exists: public procurement. Governments spend billions each year on software &amp; digital services, but most of that money flows into proprietary silos that limit transparency, reuse &amp; sovereignty.

  If we take “Public Money, Public Code” - https://publiccode.eu -  seriously, we must recognize that procurement (not donations or sponsorships) is the most powerful lever to sustain open source. Every government contract is a potential long-term investment in the commons.

  This talk examines how procurement practices can become the backbone of sustainable free software ecosystems:
	•	Why procurement reform is essential to digital sovereignty.
	•	How existing frameworks (e.g., the EU Open Source Strategy - https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/digital-services/open-source-software-strategy_en ) still fall short.
	•	How to structure tenders, contracts &amp; governance to ensure open deliverables.
	•	Why governments should stop “buying software” &amp; start funding maintenance &amp; collaboration.
	•	The opportunity for community organizations &amp; small firms to compete fairly.

  Procurement is where ideals meet infrastructure. By redirecting even a small fraction of public IT budgets toward open, reusable solutions, we can achieve what years of advocacy &amp; fundraising have not: a self-sustaining free software ecosystem that serves everyone.

      Funding the FOSS Ecosystem</p>
    <div class="notes" hidden>Procurement funds maintenance, not charity. Name + role. Thesis.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Public procurement is the largest realistic funding stream for long-term open source
        maintenance, because it is recurring, budgeted, and tied to mission delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Anchor concept:</strong> “Public Money, Public Code” argues that publicly funded software should be
        publicly reusable. https://publiccode.eu/</p>
      <p><strong>Why this talk exists:</strong> Donations are episodic. Procurement is structural. If procurement
        requires open deliverables and upstream contributions, it becomes durable funding for the commons.</p>

  <!-- Slide 2 — Problem slide: Charity Model -->
  <section class="slide" id="charity-model" aria-label="The Problem: Charity Model">
    <h2>The Problem: The Charity Model Is Broken</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relying on donations leads to maintainer burnout &amp; fragile projects</li>
      <li>Unfunded maintenance creates insecure supply chains</li>
      <li>Donations don't scale to meet the maintenance needs of infrastructure</li>
      <li class="next"><strong>Infrastructure needs ongoing, reliable investments</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <div class="notes" hidden>Supply-chain risk. Log4j, xz. Maintenance is security.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Unfunded maintenance creates systemic security risk because critical components are
        widely reused without sustainable staffing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Log4Shell (Log4j):</strong> widely used Java logging library vulnerability exposed how understaffed
          infrastructure projects can be. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-356a</li>
        <li><strong>xz-utils backdoor attempt:</strong> shows social engineering and maintainer compromise risk in core
          tooling. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-094a</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> “Maintenance” is not optional work. It is security work. Procurement can fund it
        as operational necessity.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="notes" hidden>$5 vs $50M. Crowdfunding is noise. Procurement is signal.</div>
    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> We overweight small-dollar fundraising because it is culturally familiar, but it cannot
        match the scale of public procurement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Donations/pledges:</strong> useful, but unpredictable and limited in scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement:</strong> budgets exist already; the question is what requirements they enforce (open
          deliverables, maintenance, upstream work).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example pledge framing:</strong> attempts to normalize funding commitments in industry.
        https://opensourcepledge.com</p>
      <p><strong>Speaker point:</strong> This talk is not anti-donation. It is “stop pretending donations solve
        infrastructure funding.”</p>

    <div class="details" hidden>
      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Central grants are fragile. Procurement is distributed and recurring. That creates
        resilience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grants end:</strong> timeboxed funding does not guarantee long-term maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Political risk:</strong> centrally administered funds can be cut; distributed procurement spreads
          risk across many buyers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Practical rule of thumb:</strong> When adopting OSS, allocate a predictable slice of delivery spend to
        upstream maintenance (your “~20%” example) and treat it as ongoing operations, not a one-time project cost.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Procurement controls where public money flows — fund open deliverables</li>

      <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Procurement is the largest lever because it controls where money flows and can create
        recurring maintenance funding.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fund open deliverables:</strong> require public repos, open licenses, and open standards.</li>

        <li><strong>Reuse:</strong> open deliverables let other agencies adopt without repaying for the same work.</li>
